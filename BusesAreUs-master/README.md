# BusesAreUs

Buses Are Us is an Android App that I created as my final project for CPSC 210: Software Construction at UBC. The app’s purpose is to help users locate bus stops in their vicinity and to show the arrival times and routes of buses. The app does this by taking information from XML files that hold route information from Translink’s API. The closest stop to the user is highlighted on the map and its location is displayed on the bottom of the screen. The user can also click on any of the stops to display the buses that stop at it their arrival times and also display the bus routes on the map as different coloured lines.

The apk file is in out/production/BusesAreUs_Phase2.
